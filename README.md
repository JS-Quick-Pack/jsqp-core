  <sub> An open source minecraft package management library used under JS:QP. </sub>

#### âš  Warning: ``JSQPCore`` is in very deep development so some utils and code will be incomplete. Give it a few months to develop and mature.

##### ðŸŸ£ ``JS:QP Core`` is an open source minecraft package manager written in python and heavly used under **[JS:QP](https://github.com/JS-Quick-Pack/jsqp-app)**.


> **The goal of JSQPCore is to create an open-source library to download and manage resources like texture packs, mods, data packs, skins and a lot more from Minecraft. Alongside that, because of its 100% open-source nature, we plan to support as many Minecraft launchers and versions as possible making this library the most convenient to use. This library was meant to be build-in within the [JS:QP app](https://github.com/JS-Quick-Pack/jsqp-app) but I decided to separate it for the good of it being an open-source standalone library and becoming easier for us to manage.**


*Dispite it being developed for Quick Pack you may use it just like a python libary under your own project. ðŸ˜Š*
