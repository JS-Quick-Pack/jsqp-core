## ü§î What the hell is this?
üü£ ``JS:QP Core`` is an open-source Minecraft package manager written in Python.

> WHY THE FUCK DO I NEED A PACKAGE MANAGER FOR MINECRAFT, you may ask...

First of all, jsqp-core isn't just a package manager, it will be able to do a bunch of useful stuff programmatically.

It can already:
- Detect the exact Minecraft version of a texture pack.
- Parse texture packs for stuff like pack format, legit pack name and pack description.
- *and do much more*

Imagine you had a bunch of texture packs on different Minecraft installs, now you have to manually move/copy those packs around whenever you want one on a different installation. JS:QP core can manage all of that for you with just a SINGLE copy of that texture pack increasing the unused disk space on your system.

## üß† I'm still not buying it.
JS:QP core may seem useless to you right now. That's because it is! JS:QP core is only a library at the moment and without anything hooking into it, it's boring. Soon we'll have things like GUIs and command-line interfaces. You are also open to using this library however you want.

## ‚ùì *Questions, I guess...*
  - Is jsqp core just for texture packs?
    - Nope, jsqp core will soon manage more than just texture packs, it's only that our focus right now is texture packs but once that is all gucci we can begin handling more stuff like mods, data packs and skins.

  - What is the `jsqp` in jsqp core?
    - This library was meant to be built within the [JS:QP app](https://github.com/JS-Quick-Pack/jsqp-app) which is gui app I used to work on but I decided to separate it for the good of it being a standalone open-source library and becoming easier for us to manage.

## üèÜ Our Goal
The goal of JSQPCore is to create an open-source library that can manage resources like texture packs, mods, data packs, skins and a lot more from Minecraft. Alongside that, because of its 100% open-source nature, we plan to support as many Minecraft launchers and versions as possible, encouraging the community to do so too.
